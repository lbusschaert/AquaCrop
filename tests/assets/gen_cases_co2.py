"""The CO2 file a run ends up using.

A project run names a CO2 file or says (None). What (None) means is decided in
two places: `InitializeSettings` (`initialsettings.f90`) sets a default once, at
start-up, and `LoadSimulationRunProject` (`tempprocessing.f90` 1.4) reads each
run's own entry. Nothing in the suite exercised that between them, so these
cases pin it down:

  D29  one run, no CO2 file named            -> the default record is used
  D30  two runs, the first names a file,     -> what the second run uses is the
       the second names none                    question: the default, or the
                                                file the first run left behind

D30 is the one that discriminates. FlatCO2 is a constant 369.41 ppm, the
reference concentration at which AquaCrop makes no CO2 adjustment at all, while
MaunaLoa is around 398 ppm in 2014 - so whichever record run 2 ends up on is
visible in its biomass, not merely in the run's description line.

  D31  the default record absent from SIMUL/,  -> the run should not care: it
       while the run names its own file          named a file of its own

D31 is written but commented out in main(): until the start-up read is fixed
(BUG-25, PR #379)
it does not fail, it dies - AquaCrop reads SIMUL/MaunaLoa.CO2 before it reads
the project, with no iostat, and the suite carries no case that is known to
fail. Uncomment it when the fix lands and freeze it; it is the regression guard
for that read.
